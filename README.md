# Week_9_Secure_Software

# Issues Encountered 

I enocuntered an issue in Milestone 2 when i had to download the MHN repository. The repository was not found, so I had to find a different repo. I had to change "Hurricane Labs" to "couozu" on order for it to work. 

I encountered another issue when trying to download my sessions.json file. the code: gcloud compute ssh mhn-admin --command="mongoexport --db mnemosyne --collection session > session.json" 
would not work. 

I noticed while monitoring my attacks that my "attack stats in the last 24 hours" actually went down. It was at 6506, then dropped to 6503.

# Sumary of data collected

Number of attacks: 6506
